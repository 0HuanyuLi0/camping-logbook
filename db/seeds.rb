There are toilets, tank water (not suitable for drinking but can be boiled or used for other purposes), fireplaces, picnic tables and garbage bins. Remember to bring your own drinking water, firewood, warm clothes (it gets cold at night), toilet paper and your own camping gear. Dogs are allowed in the Mt Wilson Village and at Cathedral Reserve, however dogs are not allowed in the National Park adjacent to the reserve and village. So walks around the village are ok providing they are not into the National Park."
